# Worthwhile Ideas

Ideas worth building are kind of hard to come by, so here'a bunch that are under development or need initialization.


## Solana

### Anchor for Indexing

Need a standard way for indexing on-chain state & actions so that way apps can have a standard way to access each other's state.

IMHO this is a huge blocker for composability.

### Anchor getter/setter functions for on-chain state

It would be nice if boiler plate instructions can be generated for state (init, set, get/verify)

### Guitar Tabs on Solana

Bounty program for building out [Ultimate Guitar Tabs](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) on-chain, and with a mobile-first client.

### Wordcel Meme Gen extension

Build out a meme generator on top of [Wordcel's social protocol](https://github.com/Wordcel/wordcel). Has to use on-chain information somehow. 
I think this could be really fun.

Especially if you could meme-ify other people getting wrekt on-chain.


## Stable Diffusion

### Stable diffusion meme generator

Fine tune stable diffusion to produce memes like output from [Img Flip's memegen](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator)

### Put yourself into your NFTs

... i don't know why I haven't seen variants of this on twitter yet...


### Mind Palace

Use ARKit to generate memorable images for paragraphs you want to remember, and then place those images around you using ARKit.


### AI Madlibs

Basically turn [this video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4Mcuh38wyM&ab_channel=CorridorCrew) into a game like HeadsUp where you have to create a story given a series of prompts + photos of your friends. It's like MadLibs, where AI infers a coherent story + pics from prompts placed in a hat


### Birthday eCards

Upload a photo of the recipient, and each card will generate something funky with them (GIF-like) that you can send as a holiday/birthday/special occasion :)

### Retool for Stable Diffusion
No code tooling for everything you need for to build a text-to-image generative model (include dataset fine tuning)

ie Gradio, but for Stable Diffusion only


### Live your dreams
Nobody can ever remember or accurately describe/visualize their dreams to other people - instead, you should be able to write a short sentence or two about what happened, upload a picture of the face of the friends involved, and then gets sent to the server (ideally on device) to email or text them back a super shareable comic book or short form comic strip video. Subscription service for more features/faster service. 
You are prompted to do this every morning and can have a calendar journal. 
Could include Watch health data as well as a factor of the 
Maybe train people to lucid dream / plan + live episodes themselves
